## Description

Bookmarks Manager is a Python program that converts an HTML file containing bookmarks into a CSV file. It was designed to facilitate the management and organization of bookmarks.

## Operation
The program takes an HTML file containing bookmarks (usually exported from a web browser) as input and generates a CSV file containing these bookmarks. Each bookmark is represented by a line in the CSV file, with columns for the bookmark's title, URL, and folder.

## Usage

To retrieve the program, you can clone this repository using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Redstoneur/Bookmarks_Manager.git Bookmarks_Manager

```

To use the program, you must first install the necessary dependencies by running the following command:

```

Then, you can run the program using the following command:

```bash

```

Replace `<path_to_HTML_file>` with the path to the HTML file containing your bookmarks.
